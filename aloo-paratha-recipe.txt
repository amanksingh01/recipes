Ingredients (4 Servings):
 - 4 and 3/4 potato
 - 3/4 handful coriander leaves
 - 2 and 2/3 tablespoon butter
 - 1 tablespoon salt
 - 2/3 tablespoon chaat masala
 - 2 and 3/4 green chili
 - 1/3 teaspoon black pepper
 - 3/4 large onion
 - 2/3 tablespoon red chili
 - 1/3 tablespoon garam masala powder

 For dough:
 - 1 and 1/3 cup wheat flour
 - 1/3 cup water

Directions:
 1. To make this paratha recipe, boil the potatoes and mash them in a large
    bowl. In the potatoes, add chopped onions, green chilies, coriander
    leaves, salt, garam masala powder, chaat masala and mix well so that no
    lumps remain. Ensure that you have finely chopped the onions or the filling
    will come out.

 2. Put wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Add water gradually and knead into
    a soft dough. Make small-medium balls of the dough and roll them out into
    3 to 4 inch circles. Add a spoonful of potato filling in the center.
    Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making the parathas. Be
    very careful to apply pressure evenly. It is very important to insure that
    your potato mixture is mashed well and not lumpy or you will never be able
    to make perfect parathas.

 3. Seal the dough and round it with the your fingers. Now roll them with a
    rolling pin into round parathas. Apply the pressure very evenly and gently
    on all sides.

 4. Press very lightly so that the mixture does not come out. Heat a griddle
    and roast the parathas, cooking them on both the sides with a spoonful of
    butter. If you want to use less butter on the parathas, first roast them on
    both the sides on low flame and when they are slightly crispy, apply butter
    with brush on both the sides.

 5. Serve piping hot with chilled yogurt or pickle. You can also serve the
    aloo parathas with green chutney or coconut chutney or a light gravy.
    Ideally a light potato shorba goes best with aloo ka paratha. You can also
    make a quick onion-tomato-green chili raita that tastes amazing with this
    paratha.
